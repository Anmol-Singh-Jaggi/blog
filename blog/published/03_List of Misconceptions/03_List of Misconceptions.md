Did you know that:  

 - Seasons are not caused by the Earth being closer to the Sun in the summer than in the winter and in fact, the Earth is **farthest** from the Sun when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere ?  
 - or that the Great Wall of China is not at all visible from the Moon despite being commonly claimed so ?  
 - or that humans have more than the commonly cited five senses ?  

Me neither !

To clear more of such preconceived notions and misconceptions you might have about everything around you, read this interesting [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions).
