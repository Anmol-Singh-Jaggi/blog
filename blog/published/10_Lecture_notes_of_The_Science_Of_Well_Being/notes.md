Continuing my new-found hobby of [summarizing online courses](https://anmolsinghjaggi.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/learning-how-to-learn/), in this article I will be outlining Yale University's [most popular course ever](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/nyregion/at-yale-class-on-happiness-draws-huge-crowd-laurie-santos.html) - **[The Science of Well-Being<sup>TM</sup>](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being)**.  

Here are some of the thought-provoking insights from the course:  

- This generation is less happier than the older. Anti-depressant usage has gone up by 400%.  
![Old people are happier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/old-people-more-happy.jpg "Old is Gold!")
- Happiness is 50% genetic, 10% luck and **40% controllable**. 


**What does NOT make you happy:**
 - Nice job.  
 ![Job orientation meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/job-orientation-meme.jpg "One last chance!")  
 - Good grades.
 - Prestigious school.
 - Perfect body.
 - Materialism/ High salary.  
   Money is useful only until all the **basics are covered**.  
   The more salary you get the more you want, even if you are earning **3x** the amount you originally wished for.  
   ![Money happiness meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/money.jpg "It surely helps!")
 - Relationships.  
   There is an increase in happiness for 2 years after marriage but back to normal after that.  
   ![Relationship happiness meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/relationship-meme.jpg "Hard luck!")

----------

**What does make you happy:**
 - Random acts of kindness - Help stranger/coworker, give compliments.  
 ![Compliments fishing meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/compliment.png "You are awesome! Yeah you!!")
 - Charity - Donate food, clothes, money, blood etc.  
 ![Charity meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/charity.jpg "Better than nothing")
 - Volunteering.  
  ![Volunteering meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/volunteering.jpg "Look harder")
 - Be More social - Small talk with strangers.
 - **Exercise** - Scientifically proven to be better than the best anti-depressants available.
 - Sleep.


----------

**Better wanting:**

**1. Job** 
 - We all need a job.
 - Dont focus on salary increase.
 - Try to find a job in which you are able to use your 'Signature strengths'.  
   ![Signature strengths](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/signature-strengths.jpg "Where is 'sleeping all day'?")  
 - The definition of a signature strength:
    - Ubiquitous; Widely recognized across cultures.
    - Fulfilling.
    - Morally valued in society.
    - Does not make others feel bad.
    - The opposite of a "negative trait".
    - Measurable.
    - Distinctive.
    - Paragon; Some people really have it.
    - Prodigy; Only some people have it.
    - Selective absence; Some people don't have it.
  - Go to [VIA](http://www.viacharacter.org/www/) and find out your signature strengths.
  - Use one of your strengths in a new and unique way every day for one week.
  - Try to enter and maintain a state of ***Flow***.
  - A state of 'Flow' happens when you are:
    - Working on challenging yet attainable goals.
    - Have a strong focussed concentration on the activity.
    - Working on an intrinsically rewarding activity.
    - Feeling serenity and timelesness.
    - Lose your sense of self-consciousness.
    - Lacking in awareness of physical needs.
  - People believe they will be more happy relaxing rather than working in the flow, but this is **WRONG**!!  
![Challenge vs skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/challenge-vs-skill.png "Coming up with this sketch was challenging yet relaxing")  

**2. Grades**
 - Rather than focussing on grades, focus on learning new stuff.
 - Have a growth mindset.  
![Fixed vs Growth mindset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/fixed-vs-growth-mindset.png "Hard choice, eh?")  
![Fixed vs Growth mindset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/fixed-vs-growth-mindset2.png "Hard choice, eh?")  

**3. Kindness**
 - Spending money on others gives more happiness than doing it on yourself.
 - No need to spend a fortune.  
   Spending $5 on someone else gives the same benefit as $20.  
![Charity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/kindness.png "Start with me!!")  

**4. Social connections**
 - Engage in small talk in train/bus/subway. Share a banana ;)  
  ![People chatting on subway](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/small-talk-subway.jpg "I should give my private jet a break I guess")  
 - We are afraid if talking to strangers because we think they would not want to talk to us. This is **wrong**!!!
 - People really like company.  
   In one of the experiments people were 7 times more happier when they did not have to be alone as compared to 4x increase in money.
 - Shared experiences are amplified.  
   Listening to my favourite music alone is not as fun as with my friends.  
  ![Friends listening to music](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/music-group.jpg "You can skip this if your taste in music is weird like me")    

**5. Time affuence**
 - Having enough time to do things you enjoy.
 - Prioritizing time over money brings more happiness.
 - Work for less hours even though it means less money.  
![Man relaxing on chair](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/relaxing.jpg "Aaahhhhhh..")  

**6. Meditation**
 - There's a set of neurons in our brains that get activated as soon we stop focusing on some task.
 - These neurons are responsible for ruminating about the past or planning for the future.
 - They were obviously useful from an evolutionary point of view, but they decrease happiness if it happens all the time. 
 - Mindfulness (being in the moment) training everyday just for 30 minutes boosts happiness as well as cognitive performance.
 - 3 types of mindfulness meditation:
   - Loving-Kindness
   - Breathing
   - Body
  ![Lady meditating with mountains in background](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/meditation.jpg "Can also be done without the mountains")  

**7. Health**
 - Exercise is better than the antidepressant Zoloft.
 - Make sure to get enough sleep. Aim for waking up without an alarm.

**Annoying features of the mind**

**1. Wrong intuitions**
 - Our mind's strongest intuitions are often totally wrong.
 - Most of the goals/situations that we think will make us happy don't! (Money/Job/Love)
 - *'Miswanting'* - The act of being mistaken about what and how much you're going to like something in the future.
 - Consider the following question:  
 ![Optical Illusion baseball bat price](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/illusion-baseball-bat-price.png "Wish I could play")  
  Most people answer *'10 cents'*, but the actual answer is *'5 cents'*.
 - The length of the 2 lines are exactly the same:  
 ![Optical Illusion 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/illusion-ponzo.jpg "Just kidding!")  
 ![Optical Illusion 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/illusion-line-size.jpg "Got you!")  
 - The size of the circle in the centre is the same:  
 ![Optical Illusion 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/illusion-circle-size.png "Got you again!")  
 - Random interesting animation I found somewhere because why not:  
 ![Random animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/illusion-animation.gif "Are you hypnotized yet?")  
 

**2. Comparison**
 - Mind thinks in relative not absolute. That's why we compare with others.
 - Bronze medal winners are happier than silver.  
   Silver winner thinks *'I could have won gold'*, whereas Bronze winner thinks *'I could have been out of the podium'*.  
   ![Podium happiness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/podium-happy.png "I am happy that I got to see it on TV")  
 - You wouldn't mind walking 10 kms every morning to fetch water if everyone else was doing it too.
 - Let's says you were earning 'x' dollars but now earning 2x but now you start comparing with other 2x people.
 - You feel sad for earning 1 million dollars if your coworker is earning 1.2 million.  
  ![Coworker pay-cut](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/coworker-pay-cut.png "Frogs.. sigh!")  

**3. Hedonic adaptation**
 - *'Hedonic adaptation'* - We get used to stuff.
 - A research tracked salaries in Germany for 30 years.  
   Even though salary increased significantly, yet happiness remained almost the same.
 - > Thanks to our capacity to adapt to ever greater fame and fortune, yesterday's luxuries can soon become today's necessities and tomorrow's relics.
 - Our predictions for how much we will be more happy or sad due to some pleasant or unpleasant situation is far from reality.
 - In short our happiness stays almost the same no matter what.
 - **Miswanting**: The act of being mistaken on what and how much something is going to make you happy.
 - **Impact bias:** The tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event both in terms of its intensity and its duration.
 - Impact bias is worse for negative events.
 - We are really bad at predicting this and **we don't get better at this!**.  
   In a study where teens forecasted their happiness level if they failed a driver's exam, teens continued to mispredict happiness even if they had failed their drivers test a few times before.
 - Why are we bad at this:  
   - **Focalism**: Just focussing on one negative thing.
   - **Immune neglect**: We underestimate how resilient we are. We should not be afraid and take risks in life. It will all be okay.  
  ![All is well](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/all-is-well.jpg "Just chill!")  

----------

**Solutions to the annoying features of the mind**

**1. Experiences instead of materials**
 - Don't be materialistic to beat hedonic adaptation.  
   Problem is that a new car stays and you get used to it. It is permanent!  
 - Invest in experiences instead.  
   The fact that vacation is just 1 week long is a good thing.
 - People think highly of you you more if you invest in experiences rather than stuff. Also they don't get jealous of you!  
   ![Traveller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/traveller.jpg "I wish travelling was cheap")  

**2. Savoring**
 - Step outside of an experience to review and appreciate it. Just be aware when experiencing something positive.  
   *Be in the moment*.  
  ![Woman smelling flower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/savouring.jpg "I would have savoured if I wasn't allergic to roses")  
 - Savour happy memories of the past.
 - Activities that hurt savoring:
   - Focusing on the future.
   - Reminding yourself that it would be over soon.
   - Telling yourself that it wasn't as good as you had hoped.
   - Reminding yourself that nothing lasts forever.
   - Thinking it would never be this good again.
   - Thinking about ways to make it better.
   - Telling yourself that you didn't deserve this.
   - Just taking pictures (for the Instagram generation).  

**3. Negative visualisation**
 - Think of ways it could it could have gone worse.  
   Use your imagination!

**4. Make this day your last**
  - Just imagine this is the last day of your life.
  - You will be fully involved in anything that you're doing.
  - Helps in enjoying the moment; even the trivial ones.  
   ![Last day of life text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/last-day.jpg "Dance like there's no tomorrow")  

**5. Gratefulness**
  - Write a gratitude diary every week.
  - Send a hand-written *Thank-you note* to friends and family. Even better if you recite the note to them directly.  
   ![Gratefulness diary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/grateful-diary.jpg "Does anyone have a pen please? Thank you!")  

**6. Reset your reference points**
 - Concretely re-experience.  
   You got your dream job but after 1 week you get used to it. How to prevent it?  
   Imagine/Re-experience how your situation was before.
 - Concretely observe.  
   Think in a whole-rounded and unbiased way about whatever you are fantasizing about to see that it also has a lot of flaws.
 - Avoid social comparison -> Be mindful of those thoughts.
 - Interrupt your positive consumption.  
   This one sounds counter-intuitive but really works.  
   Stop your favourite song/tv-show in between. You'll feel much happier when you resume it.
 - Dont interrupt negative consumption; Same theory as above.
 - Increase variety; Do more things and dont do the same thing frequently.
 - Don't watch TV!
 - Quit all social networking websites!  
  ![Quit social networks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/facebook.png "not going to happen..")  

----------

**Strategies For Better Habits**

**1. Situational support**
 - Delete social media from your phone.
 - Reminders on washroom mirror to meditate.
 - Stay away from friends who are smokers if you want to quit.
 - Keep the candies away from your working desk.

**2. Goal setting**
 - Goal specificity  
   - The degree of quantitative precision with which a goal is defined.
   - Meditate; Where? When? How many times?
 - Goal planning  
   - Implementation intention - A self-regulatory strategy in the form of an "if-then" plan that can lead to better goal attainment.
      - `If I am in the dining hall and I see the pizza slice, I'll turn away and grab the orange.`
      - `When I think of door knob, think keys!`
   - *WOOP* (Wish Outcome Obstacles Plan)  
     - Get a clear idea on what you want.
     - Imagine how good the outcome will be.
     - Imagine all the possible obstacles.
     - Make a plan on how to overcome obstacle.  
     ![WOOP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anmol-Singh-Jaggi/blog/master/blog/published/10_Lecture_notes_of_The_Science_Of_Well_Being/assets/woop.png "Woops!!")
